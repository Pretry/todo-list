Hello there,

Welcome here on my first React project : my todo-list

//STACK

> React Hooks => useContext()
> Basic CSS

//WHY DID I USE USECONTEXT ?
At first I wanted to carry the data in a normal way. After passing data to the deeper components, I had to lift it up using callback function. At this moment, I faced async issues. After browsing the web, I discovered useContext which is a built in Redux => It solved all my issues and this is the reason why I finished this project quicker.

//PRECISION
I didn't focus on the design part at all, neither on the responsiveness. My goal is to become good at the back-end of the front end as quick as I can.
